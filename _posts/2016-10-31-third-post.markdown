## Today I went through the CSS diner tutorial again to brush up on some things before class. It's a great exercise to become
familiar with some basic css knowledge and function. I am also becoming more and more familiar with adding to this blog and
the homework. Coding is even more fun than I expected and I am up for the challenge. Cheers.
